    <p>Cybersecurity wiki provides a set of evolving resources on cybersecurity, broadly defined, and includes an annotated list of relevant articles and literature, which can be searched in a number of ways. Please see below. It is intended as a tool/resource for researchers, technologists, students, policy-makers and others who are interested in cybersecurity issues more broadly. For more information about this first phase of the project, including the team, methodology, and opportunities to contribute CISQ develops standards for automating the measurement of software size and software structural quality. CISQ is a special interest group of the Object Management Group that submits specifications for approval as OMG international standards. The measurement standards are used for the static program analysis of software, a software testing practice that identifies critical vulnerabilities in the code and architecture of a software system Entiter Security related patches for Cyber Assets utilized in the operation of the Registered Entities are required to check for new patches once every thirty five calendar days. Upon identification of a new patch, entities are required to evaluate applicability of a patch and then complete mitigation or installation activities within 35 calendar days of completion of assessment </p>
